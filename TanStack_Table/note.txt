What is TanStack ?
Headless, type-safe, & powerful utilities for Web Applications, Routing, State Management, Data Visualization, Datagrids/Tables, and more.

Library	Purpose

TanStack Query	Manage server-state (APIs) easily.
TanStack Router	Handle routing in React apps.
TanStack Virtual	Optimize big lists (like 10,000+ items).

What is headless ?

As it was mentioned extensively in the Intro section, TanStack Table is headless. This means that it doesn't render any DOM elements, and instead relies on you, the UI/UX developer to provide the table's markup and styles. This is a great way to build a table that can be used in any UI framework, including React, Vue, Solid, Svelte, Qwik, and even JS-to-native platforms like React Native!


DataTypes: TData

type User = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
  visits: number
  progress: number
  status: string
}

//note: data needs a "stable" reference in order to prevent infinite re-renders
const data: User[] = []
